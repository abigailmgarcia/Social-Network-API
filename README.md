# Social-Network-API

## Description

This project allowed me to focus on backend database building using a No SQL programming language like MongoDB/Mongoose. As a full-stack developer I want to strengthen skills in both back and front-end design and structure. There are so many applications and companies that rely on databases in the social network market. I wanted to show that I have the experience and ability to do so as well. In this application I learned a lot about how to work with No SQL databases and connect them to API's.
